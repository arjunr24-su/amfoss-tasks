Forged in the celestial forges of Sigmaron, the Celestial Veil Amulet is a relic born of divine intervention to combat the malevolent forces that threaten the balance of existence. When worn, the Celestial Veil Amulet emanates a radiant glow, warding off malevolent influences and shielding the bearer from the corrupting touch of the Chaos.
