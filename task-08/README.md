Writing a blog about my experience with the “Type Maestro” project was a mix of excitement and challenges. As a college student, I found it tough to explain the technical stuff in a way that was both clear and interesting. It was a fun challenge. Despite the hurdles, the whole process was super rewarding and really helped me improve my typing skills. It was a great learning experience that made me appreciate the skills of typewriters.
