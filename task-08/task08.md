 **Title:** Mastering the Art of Typing: My Journey with Type Maestro


**introduction**

In the programming world, typing is as fundamental as breathing. It’s an essential skill that connects our minds to the code we write. But despite its importance, many programmers, myself included, tend to overlook proper typing techniques. When I first encountered the “Type Maestro” project, I saw it as an opportunity to hone this basic but crucial skill. Little did I know that this journey would not only make me faster at the keyboard but also change my perspective on productivity and ergonomics.


**Start: Work**

The "Type Maestro" project was simple in its conception but profound in its potential impact. The goal was to develop proficiency in tactile typing through consistent practice at [typing.com](https://www.typing.com)[Monkeytyping.com](https://www.monkeytyping.com). It was recommended to use 5-10 minutes a day in guided learning to slowly build muscle memory in the workplace. The ultimate goal is to achieve a typing speed of at least 60 words per minute (WPM) with at least 95% accuracy on a 30-second test in a popular typing speed test method overwriting Monkeytype



**Technical description: Practice**

I started my journey by creating an account on typing.com. The platform offers a set of lessons designed to take you from a beginner to an expert in touch typing. At first, the classes seemed mundane, but I soon realized that they are crucial for building muscle memory. The first few days were slow and a bit frustrating; my fingers stumbled over the keys, and my speed wasn't impressive at all. But I stuck with it and practiced for 10 minutes a day, because consistency was key.

As the days turned into weeks, I started to notice significant improvement. My fingers began to move more fluidly across the keyboard, and I spent less time looking down at my hands. I began to understand the importance of the home row, and placing my fingers there gave me better access to the other keys. By the end of the first week, I was typing faster than before, although I was still shy of the 60 WPM goal.

The challenge of achieving 60 WPM with 95% accuracy was both motivating and daunting. It required not just speed, but precision. The real test came on Monkeytype, where I initially struggled to balance speed and accuracy. But with constant practice, I learned to focus on typing accurately first and let the speed develop over time. By the third week, I was consistently hitting the 60 WPM mark with accuracy hovering around 95%. It was a fulfilling moment when I finally reached my goal, knowing that my hard work and perseverance had paid off.

Even though my original laptop died during the task, I didn't let that stop me. I borrowed a laptop from my neighbor and continued practicing. This setback taught me the importance of adaptability and persistence, and it made reaching my goal even more satisfying.



**Opinion: My Opinion and Experience**
The "Type Maestro" project was a rewarding journey that not only made me a more accomplished writer but also reinforced the value of patience and consistent practice. For anyone who wants to improve their writing skills, I highly recommend making time to practice every day. It may seem tedious at first, but the benefits—faster typing speeds, increased performance, and better ergonomics—are well worth the effort. Plus, there is the distinct satisfaction of knowing you can type faster and more accurately than most of your peers!
